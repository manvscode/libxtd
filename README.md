## Building

### Linux
Building requires Autotools.

1. `apt install -y autoconf automake libtool`
1. `autoreconf -i`
1. `./configure`
1. `make`
1. `make install`

### MacOS X
Building requires Homebrew and Autotools.
1. `brew install autoconf automake libtool`
1. `autoreconf -i`
1. `./configure`
1. `make`
1. `make install`

### Cross-compiling for Windows with MinGW

1. `autoreconf -i`
1. Run the configure script for the host architecture:
	* For x86: `./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32`
	* For x86_64: `./configure --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32`
1. `make`
1. `make install`
