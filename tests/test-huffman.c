		"part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever "
		"I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever "
		"I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I "
		"meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral "
		"principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats "
		"off- then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. "
		"With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing "
		"surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very "
		"nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.\n\n"
		"There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs- "
		"commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is "
		"the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous "
		"were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.\n\n"
		"Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, "
		"by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?--Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands "
		"upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-"
		"heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get "
		"a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster--tied to "
		"counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?\n";
